    <h1 class="custom-title">The Hazards of CME's</h1>
    <div class="image-container text-center">
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dkWg3XHQp7sZ9fttAWnwyb.jpg" alt="Asteroid Image" class="img-fluid" style="width: 50%; height: 50%;">
        <h4 class="larger-text-left">What are the risks of CME's?</h4>
        <p class="main-body-text">Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) pose a significant threat to Earth's technological infrastructure and space environment. When a CME—a massive 
            burst of solar plasma and magnetic fields—collides with Earth's magnetosphere, it can trigger geomagnetic storms capable of disrupting satellite operations, GPS 
            navigation, and high-frequency radio communications. Power grids are particularly vulnerable, as strong geomagnetic currents induced by CMEs can overload and damage 
            transformers, potentially causing widespread blackouts. Additionally, increased radiation levels during CME events pose health risks to astronauts and high-altitude 
            airline passengers, especially near the poles. As our reliance on space-based and electrical technologies grows, understanding and preparing for CME impacts becomes 
            increasingly critical for global safety and resilience.</p>

        <h4 class="larger-text-left">The beauty with the danger.</h4>
        <p class="main-body-text">Auroras, often admired for their breathtaking beauty, are natural light displays that shimmer across the polar skies in brilliant greens, 
            purples, and reds. These mesmerizing curtains of light are caused by charged particles from the Sun—often from a coronal mass ejection (CME)—colliding with Earth's 
            magnetic field and atmosphere. While typically seen near the poles, auroras visible much farther south than usual can be a striking signal of intense solar activity. 
            Such displays may indicate that a powerful CME has impacted Earth, potentially disrupting satellites, power grids, and communication systems. In this way, the beauty 
            of the aurora can also serve as a dramatic and visible warning of space weather hazards.</p>
        <h4 class="larger-text-left">Modeling the potential danger of a CME given it's features.</h4>
        <p class="main-body-text">In our analysis, we used a regression-based machine learning model to evaluate and predict the potential threat of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs)
             by creating a DangerIndex. This model took into account features such as the CME's speed, angular width (halfAngle), and its likelihood of impacting Earth 
             (impactProbability) created using the Longitute and Latitude in combination with the half angle, and learned patterns from past CME events and their associated geomagnetic disturbances (represented by averaged Kp indices). By training on 
             this data, the model was able to estimate a continuous threat score for new or observed CME events. In a real-world scenario, such a system could be integrated into 
             early-warning frameworks to help space weather agencies assess the risk posed by incoming CMEs more rapidly and consistently—supporting decisions like satellite 
             shielding, grid operator alerts, or aviation route adjustments.</p>
