        <img src="https://www.aura-astronomy.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/The-Suns-Polar-Magnetic-Field-will-Soon-Flip.jpg" alt="Asteroid Image" class="img-fluid" width="50%" height="50%">  
        <h4 class="larger-text-left">What causes CMEs?</h4>
        <p class="main-body-text">Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are massive bursts of solar plasma and magnetic fields that erupt from the Sun's corona, its outermost atmosphere. 
            They are caused by the sudden release of energy stored in the Sun’s magnetic field, often triggered by processes such as magnetic reconnection. This can occur when 
            twisted magnetic field lines near sunspots snap and realign, flinging billions of tons of charged particles into space at high speeds. CMEs are frequently associated 
            with solar flares and active regions on the Sun, and when directed toward Earth, they can interact with our planet’s magnetic field, potentially leading to 
            geomagnetic storms.</p>

        <h4 class="larger-text-left">The 11 Year Solar Cycle.</h4>
        <p class="main-body-text">The 11-year solar cycle, also known as the Schwabe cycle, refers to the periodic rise and fall in solar activity driven by changes in the Sun’s 
            magnetic field. This cycle manifests in variations in the number of sunspots, darker cooler regions on the Sun’s surface linked to magnetic disturbances, as well as in 
            the frequency of solar flares and CMEs. At the peak of the cycle, called solar maximum, sunspot numbers and solar activity are high; at solar minimum, they are low. 
            The underlying cause is the solar dynamo process: the complex movement of plasma inside the Sun that twists and regenerates its magnetic field over time. As the 
            magnetic field becomes increasingly tangled and eventually reverses polarity, it drives the rhythmic nature of the cycle, impacting space weather and conditions on 
            Earth.</p>

        <h4 class="larger-text-left">What are the types of CME's?</h4>
        <p class="main-body-text">Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) can be observationally classified based on the instruments and wavelengths through which they are detected. 
            The most common type is C-type, observed by coronagraphs such as SOHO's LASCO instruments, which block direct sunlight to visualize the expanding plasma cloud in 
            the solar corona. S-type CMEs are associated with enhancements in soft X-ray emissions, often linked to solar flares observed by space-based X-ray telescopes like 
            GOES. E-type CMEs are identified through activity in Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths, particularly using instruments like the EIT (Extreme ultraviolet Imaging 
            Telescope) aboard SOHO. These classifications help correlate the CME's visual and energetic characteristics with their solar source regions and improve understanding 
            of their potential impact on Earth.</p>
